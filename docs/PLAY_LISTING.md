Keep it calm and moving — auto‑replies that respect your boundaries.

## Full Description
DayleSMS AI drafts respectful, concise replies so you can stay in control without getting dragged into long arguments. It analyzes tone, de‑escalates when needed, and proposes concrete next steps like a call or time to meet.

What it does:
- Writes brief, calm replies that match your style
- De‑escalates tense threads with clear boundaries
- Proposes times or a quick call in one step
- Remembers just enough context to stay consistent
- Works with your own server and webhooks

Privacy & Security:
- Your data stays on your server (`dayle_data/`)
- Optional integrations (Twilio/Messenger) only if you enable them
- License data is encrypted; you control activation

Notes:
- Play Store version removes SMS send/receive permissions; it uses notification access and your server. For SMS integration, use the non‑store version.
